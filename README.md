# Potential-flow
Calculates potential flow in 2D, using the finite differences method to solve the potential flow equation.
Takes as input a matrix of integers (from 0 to 3), where 0 is an obstacle, 1 a cell with fluid, and 2 and 3 represent where the fluid enters and exits.

An example program using a small image as input can be found here: [Main Code](pic_obstacles.py)

Details on input/output and internal workings of each function can be found on the report: [Technical Report.pdf](Technical%20Report.pdf)
